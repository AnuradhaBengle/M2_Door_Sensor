## TEST PLAN 
First write the source code of your program in WIRAVR SOFTWARE .
Save it . Then makefile of the source code . Remember your code must be with HEX file extention name then only it will work on simuleide.
When you will go on simuleide RIGHT click on microcontroller their you will find LOAD FIRMWARE click on that , search the hex file of your program and upload it and then the stimulation will run.
WE NEED HEX FILE ONLY TO RUN THE CODE.
THEN YOU WILL SEE THE OUTPUT.
