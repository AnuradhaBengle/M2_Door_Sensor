## INTRODUCTION
In this project, we will go over how to build a door sensor circuit.

This is a circuit where an led will go off if the door that the circuit is connected to is opened.

When the door is ordinarily closed, the led is not triggred. When the door is opened up, the led goes off, alerting us that the door has been opened.

So this led circuit has really good practical use when we want to be alerted to when a door has opened.

## ***4 W's and 1H***
### What:
         This project is for safety purpose.
### Why:
         To check wheather the door is closed.
### When:
         The project is used when the person is not at his/her house.
### Who: 
          This project can be used who needs more safety.
          
## ***SWOTH ANALYSIS***
### Strength:
         SAFETY AND SECURITY.
### Weakness:
         PRICING .
### Opportuities:
         KEEP OUT THIEF , PEACE OF MIND.
### Threat: 
          ONLY WORKS ON ELECTRICITY , SO WHEN POWER OFF NO SIGNAL.
